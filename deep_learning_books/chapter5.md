# Chapter 5. Machine Learning Basics 

## Overview

Machine learning is a form of **applied statistics** that with increased emphasis on the use of computer to statistically estimate complicated functions and a decreases emphasis on proving confidence interval around these functions.



## 5.1 Learning Algorithm 

### Definition of learning algorithm 

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some classes of T and performance P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.



### 5.1.1 The Task

* Classification
* Classification with missing inputs
* Regression
* Transcription
* Machine Translation 
* Structured output 
* Anomaly detection 
* Synthesis and sampling 
* Imputation of missing values 
* Denoise
* Density estimation 



### 5.1.2 The Performance Measure 

Use **test set** to evaluate the performance 



### 5.1.3 The Experience

* Supervised 
* Unsupervised 



### 5.1.4 Example: Linear Regression

Refer to the book





## 5.2 Capacity, Overfitting and Underfitting
